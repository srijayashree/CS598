>ðŸ“‹  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install transformers 
 
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
Model_finetuning_2tests.ipynb 
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xlLYSoa_5tWJ2ekAAZZV_P0nOWN1HFf8#scrollTo=lD9afARpmTWh) trained on MIMC-iii datasets. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

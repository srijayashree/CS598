## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install transformers 
 
```
## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
Model_finetuning_2tests.ipynb 
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :
